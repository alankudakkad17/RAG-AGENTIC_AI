Through years of making smoothies, I’ve found that a handful of spinach is almost undetectable, so toss some into a fruit smoothie for extra nutrients! Alternatively, blend in a superfood like hemp seeds, nut butter, matcha, or maca powder for an extra healthy kick. [...] If you’re looking for tried and true easy breakfast ideas, toast is the thing for you! Pop a slice of whole grain bread in the toaster, and load it up with your favorite seasonal toppings. I like to start with a creamy spread and then add a layer of roasted or raw veggies, fruit, and/or fresh herbs. I’m a diehard fan of avocado toast, but hummus, ricotta, and nut butter are good starting points for making delicious toast too. [...] If you’re someone who wants to prioritize protein in your breakfast, egg recipes are a great choice. Make a quick omelet, scrambled eggs, or fried eggs in the morning, or try one of the recipes below to change things up. Make egg bites for a portable breakfast option, for example.

These organs are considered nature’s superfoods—rich in vitamins (A, B12, folate), minerals (zinc, selenium, copper), and bioactive compounds vital for optimal human function. Unlike plant foods, which contain antinutrients such as oxalates, phytates, and lectins that can impair mineral absorption and stimulate inflammation, organ meats provide these nutrients in highly bioavailable forms, free from plant defense chemicals that evolved to deter herbivory.\n",

The carnivore elimination protocol further emphasizes eliminating plants entirely to reduce exposure to potential toxins and improve health markers. Since human physiology is optimized for high-quality animal protein and fat intake, this approach aligns with our biology, obviating the need for fiber found in plant foods—which humans did not historically rely on for energy or essential nutrients. Dietary fiber is largely indigestible, and current evidence suggests it is unnecessary for humans when consuming adequate animal fats and proteins. Instead, fiber may contribute to gut issues or dysbiosis in susceptible individuals.\n",
